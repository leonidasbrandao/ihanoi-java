# This is an interactive game simulating the legend of Towers of Hanoi.
# The iHanoi is implemented in Java and allows to register the moviments performed by the learner.

sobre[1]  = \                   Towers of Hanoi Problem
sobre[2]  = \  The Towers of Hanoi problem was initially proposed by the French mathematician
sobre[3]  = FranÃ§ois Ã‰douard Anatole Lucas, in 1883. Lucas proposed an curious legend to his
sobre[4]  = \"game\": the Tower of Brahma (or Towers of Hanoi) was created at beginning
sobre[5]  = of the world, with 3 rods (sticks), the first one with 64 concentric discs.
sobre[6]  = \  The \"world creator\" also created a community of monkeys with a single task,
sobre[7]  = to move all the discs from the first rod (\"A\") to the destination one (\"C\").
sobre[8]  = The creator established that the world will reaches its end when the monkeys
sobre[9]  = finished their job. However, the monkeys must respect 3 laws:
sobre[10] = \    1. never put a bigger disc over any smaller one;
sobre[11] = \    2. it is possible to move a single disc per time;
sobre[12] = \    3. any disc is under movement or rest in one of the 3 rods.
sobre[13] = \  Here is the challenge: try to find an scheme (algorithm) to perform the job using
sobre[14] = the minimum number of disc movement. By doing so, you could estimate the time
sobre[15] = the world has until its ending (in accordance to the legend!!).
sobre[16] = \  To solve the second problem of the puzzle (estimate the remaining time), you can
sobre[17] = admit the a constant time move any single disc (e.g. 1 second). Try to find a
sobre[18] = formula that represent the number of movements by using \"n\" discs (function).
