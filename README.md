iHanoi

This implementation was designed to be used under classroom situations.

It can be used as "applet" or application.

It can be integrated to Moodle (2.X and 3.X) by using the iAssign package:

It allow a teacher to prepare activities with automatic evaluation (the number of discs can be defined).
If it is integrated with Moodle/iAssign, the learner answer is registered and if the learner reach the
minimum number of movements. The teacher also can verified all the movements performed by the learner.

iHanoi is implemented in Java, using AWT (so it can be used, almost, by the first Java Virtual Machine version).
